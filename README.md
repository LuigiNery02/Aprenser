Aprenser is a study project focused on HTML structure and layout, utilizing elements like header, nav, div, section, and footer to create a well-organized webpage. Additionally, CSS was used to style the page, enhancing visual appeal and usability. This project helped refine my understanding of semantic HTML and styling techniques for structured web pages.
